    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Two fundamental concepts enables Amazon Aurora help meet requirements that need to be satisfied by any cloud based database like seamless scalability, high availability, fault tolerance, quick recovery without compromising on performance or increase in maintenance effort.</p>

<ul>
<li>Monotonically increasing Log Sequence Number (LSN) attached to each log record which is written for changes</li>
<li>A multi tenant distributed storage system built for databases to which multiple database instances can be attached. The storage system performs the persistence functions of a traditional database like writing logs to disk, creating and persisting data pages i.e. the custom storage system understands log records and data pages. Also the storage system makes it possible for Aurora to segregate the compute components of databases namely the SQL layer, transaction management and caching from the storage layer</li>
</ul>

<h2>Storage System</h2>

<p><img src="/images/aurora/Aurora-storage-workflow.png" ALIGN=”left” /></p>

<p>The storage system exposes API to write redo logs which a database instance can use to persist a redo log entries and need to pass in the LSN for the change while doing so. Since this is a network IO, the database instance can make the request to persist log entries as soon as changes are made. This is in contrast to traditional database where log entries are buffered to group them before persisting since it involves disk IO.  The storage system persists the log entry to a “hot log” and acknowledges the database instance. This is the only write request made from the database instance to the storage system which reduces the number of IOs by a factor of ~7 per transaction.  Data is stored in 10 GB chunks called segments and replicated 6 ways. For availability and recovery, 2 out of 6 copies are made available in an availability zone with a total of 3 AZs where data is stored. The logical group of 6 segments is called the protection group (PG). Storage segments are distributed across storage nodes which are EC2 instances in AWS. Chain of PGs constitutes a database volume which has a one to one relationship to a database instance and the volume can grow as data grows by adding new PGs. The database instance maintains the metadata about the segments, the protection group to which it is part of, the storage nodes which are responsible for the segments along with the data pages and log offsets which is stored in each segment in AWS key value store DynamoDB.</p>

<p>Database instance sends write requests to all the segments for log write and the write is considered successful if 4 out of the 6 storage node acknowledges that the write is successful. The storage system can identify issues with any storage node or segment and when one is found it will add a  new protection group by replacing the segment with issues with a new segment to the members of the existing protection group. The database instance can decide which PG to drop based on how quickly the issue with the old segment is resolved. Since the write is coordinated by the database instance, there is no need to consensus protocols in the storage layer which reduces complexity.</p>

<p><img src="/images/aurora/Aurora-read-replication.png" ALIGN=”left” /></p>

<p> In the background the storage system coalesces log entries, create/update data pages, garbage collect unwanted data pages, perform consistency checks of pages and backup data pages to external storage like S3 for recovery relieving the database instance from these operations. This also allows multiple database instances to be attached to the same storage volume. When there are multiple read instances attached to the same storage volume, the write instance along with sending log write requests to the storage system, it will also send the log entries to the read database instances so that they can keep their buffer caches current. Multiple write instances are enabled by pre-allocating range of LSNs for each instance so that there are no conflicts between the updates made through the various instances. If transactions from two write instances updates the same rows in a table, the transaction for which the 4 out of 6 quorum writes completes first gets committed and the other transaction will fail.</p>

<p>Aurora database instances maintains various consistency points enabled by the monotonically increasing LSN which makes distributed commits and recovery simpler. Segment complete LSN (SCL) is the low watermark below which all the log records has been received. When there are holes in the log records, storage nodes gossip with other nodes in the PG to which is the segment is part of to fill the holes. Protection group complete LSN (PGCL) keeps track of when 4/6 segment SCLs advance in a PG. Volume complete LSN (VCL) tracks the LSN when PGCLs advance at all the PGs. When a recovery happens, the storage system can truncate all the log records with an LSN larger than the VCL can be truncated.</p>

<p>Database can also set a recovery point based transactions. Each database level transactions is broken into multiple mini-transactions (MTR) that need to be performed in order and atomically. The final record in a mini transaction is marked as Consistency Point LSN (CPL). Volume durable LSN (VDL) tracks the CPL which is smaller than or equal to VCL. During recovery, the database establishes the durable point to be the VDL and the storage system truncates all data above that consistency point.</p>

<h2>Database Cloning</h2>

<p>Cloning database will result in the new database pointing to the same logs and data pages of the original database i.e. the clone will much quicker and will be able to perform reads on the data as of that point in time. Creation of new log segments and data pages are done as writes a made through the new database instance. This satisfies the need for reducing cost of creating database clone and the speed in a cloud offering.</p>

<h2>Database Backtracking</h2>

<p>Aurora can be configured to track changes so that state of the database can be moved to a previous point in time quickly for any reasons like data corruption due to incorrect code. Once backtracking is configured, data pages are not garbage collected by the storage system and tracked so that users can go back to a desired point time.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://web.mit.edu/Saltzer/www/publications/endtoend/endtoend.pdf">This paper</a> presents the design principle regarding placement of functions in computer system design called &ldquo;end-to-end argument&rdquo;.  The argument of the principle is that any application functions implemented at lower levels of a system may be redundant or of little value when compared with the cost of providing them at lower level.  The paper articulates the argument through requirements and examples in distributed systems like reliable data transmission, encryption, duplicate message detection, message sequencing, detecting host crashes, delivery receipts etc.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Reliable Data Transmission</p>

<ul>
<li>Even if the communication network provides aid in coping with issues in data transmission like data buffering issues, processor or memory issues, loss of packet, host crashes through duplicate copies, timeout and retry, redundancy for error detection, crash recovery etc, at the end the data transfer application need to perform the check of the data transferred to claim it to be successful</li>
<li>This makes the functions in the network layer for reliable data transfer redundant. More over these functions will impact other applications which will be using the network layer but doesn&rsquo;t require all the functions</li>
</ul>


<p>Lower layers can implement function which can improve the performance of the application using it. For e.g. in the case of reliable data transmission</p>

<ul>
<li>The application need to make sure that the data transferred matches the source for e.g. by using checksums. If the checksum at the source and target don&rsquo;t match the data transfer need to be redone</li>
<li>If functions can be included which will cost less but enhances the end to end reliability this will reduce the retries required to have the data data transferred reliably and hence improves the performance</li>
</ul>


<p>Decisions to include functions in lower layers</p>

<ul>
<li>Need to take into account the cost of implementing it at the lower layer and the impact on other applications which may be using it</li>
<li>Need to be made with the understanding that the higher level layers will have much more information than the lower level layers to guarantee a feature/functionality</li>
</ul>


<p>In order to make these decisions i.e. whether to include functions in lower layers or let the application handle it at the end, application requirements of what need to be accomplished need to be well understood.</p>

    <updated>2016-01-10T18:51:35-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://asquareb.github.io/blog/2016/01/10/scale-in-distributed-systems</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://clifford.neuman.name/papers/pdf/94--_scale-dist-sys-neuman-readings-dcs.pdf">This paper</a> looks at scale and how it affects distributed systems including highlights of how how scale is addressed in existing systems.
A system is said to be <strong>scalable</strong> if it can handle addition of resources and users without suffering noticeable loss in performance or increase in administrative complexity. Scale also affects the way users perceive the systems. For e.g. as the number of objects accessible grows it becomes increasingly difficult to locate the objects of interest.</p>

<ul>
<li>Definitions

<ul>
<li>A <strong>distributed system</strong> is a collection of computers, connected by a computer network, working together to collectively implement some minimal set of services.</li>
<li>A service or resource is <strong>replicated</strong> when it has multiple logically identical instances appearing on different nodes in a system</li>
<li>A service is <strong>distributed</strong> when it is provided by multiple nodes each capable of handling a subset of the requests for service. A distribution function maps requests to the subset of the nodes that can handle it</li>
<li><strong>Caching</strong> is a temporary form of replication used to save and reuse of query results on nodes. Caching need to use validation techniques to make sure that the data saved are current</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Effects of Scale

<ul>
<li>Reliability

<ul>
<li>Systems should not cease to operate just because nodes are unavailable</li>
<li>Reliability can be improved by increasing the autonomy of the nodes and replication</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>System Load

<ul>
<li>System query load increases with increase in amount of data, nodes, services</li>
<li>Replication, distribution and caching can be used to reduce the number of requests that need to be handled by each node</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Administration

<ul>
<li>With increase in number of nodes, administration of users, services and systems becomes complex</li>
<li>Complexity in administration can be reduced by maintaining common information centrally</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Heterogeneity

<ul>
<li>With scale nodes part of the system can not only of different hardware but can also run different OS and different versions of OS</li>
<li><strong>Coherence</strong> an approach which expects nodes in a system support a common interface is one which is used to deal with heterogeneity

<ul>
<li>Common instruction set</li>
<li>Common execution abstraction</li>
<li>Support a common set of protocols</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Distributed system components affected by scale

<ul>
<li>Naming and directory services</li>
<li>Authentication</li>
<li>Authorization</li>
<li>Accounting</li>
<li>Communication</li>
<li>Remote Resources</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p><em>Scaling of all the components can be improved by replication, distribution and caching</em></p>

<p>Key points to remember while building scalable systems</p>

<ul>
<li>Replication

<ul>
<li>Replication important resources</li>
<li>Distribute the replicas</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Distribution

<ul>
<li>Distribute across multiple servers</li>
<li>Distribute evenly</li>
<li>Exploit locality</li>
<li>Avoid upper level of hierarchies</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Caching

<ul>
<li>Cache frequently accessed data</li>
<li>Consider access patterns when caching

<ul>
<li>amount of data accessed together, read to write ratio, likelihood of conflicts, number of simultaneous users</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cache timeouts</li>
<li>Caching at multiple levels</li>
<li>Look first locally</li>
<li>Data cached extensively must be changed less frequently</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Avoid global broadcast</li>
<li>Shed load but not too much: perform computation where it suits better</li>
