Wondering which IT systems or work load can be moved to Public Cloud to take advantage of its high cost benefit and at the sametime mitigate some of the [concerns](/blog/2010/11/15/why-and-why-not-cloud/). The following is an broad categorization of systems/work loads which can be targeted for the different Cloud deployment models.
<!--more-->
**For Public Cloud**

- Systems which do not deliver competitive advantage
- Systems which are not mission critical
- Work loads which do not handle core business
- Workloads which uses less sensitive data
- Work loads which are affected minimally by network latency or bandwidth
- Systems which are not tightly integrated to other critical systems
- Systems which use industry standard workflow and requires minimal customizations
- Infrastructure workloads like
  - Audio/video/Web conferencing
  - Test and development environments
  - Less sensitive data archiving

**For Private Cloud**

All the systems/work loads which have the characteristics opposite to or not mentioned in the previous section  can be targeted for Private Cloud. Some examples are

- Work loads dealing with the high sensitive data like medical records
- Multiple, co-dependent mission critical systems like online transaction processing
- Work loads requiring high audibility and accountability like SOX
- Systems using third party software that do not have virtualization or cloud licensing strategy
- Work loads requiring detailed utilization measurement and charge back mechanisms

Like to hear your experience on other criteria used to choose workload that can be moved to Public Cloud.
